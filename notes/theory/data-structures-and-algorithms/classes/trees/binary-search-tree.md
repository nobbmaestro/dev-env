# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree is a simple variation on the standard tree which has three restriction on it to help organize the data

- A Node can have at most 2 children
- For any given parent Node, the child to the left has a value less tan or equal to itself, and the child to the right has a value greater than or equal to itself
- Node two Nodes can contain the same value

The biggest advantage of Binary Search Trees is that we’re able to search through them in Logarithmic Time

Searching process in a Binary Search Tree

- Go left if the value we’re searching for is less than current Node
- Go right if the value we’re searching for is greater than the current Node

Makes Binary Search Trees extremely popular for string large quantities of data that need to be easily searchable

- Also translates to accessing, inserting and deleting Nodes

Use cases for Binary Search Trees
